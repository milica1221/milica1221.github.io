                <p class="paragraph-1">Nova Vector is designed as a multi-tenant architecture that physically integrates tenants while keeping them logically separated. It runs a single instance of the software on one server or server farm and serves multiple tenants. With the use of roles, clients can set restricted access to specific assets for fine-grained management.</p>

                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Vector's FaaS module uses serverless architecture to run small, modular functions. This approach offers several benefits, including simplified developer logistics, increased agility, faster updates, and greater responsiveness to customer needs.

                    Additionally, the FaaS model allows for individual functions to scale automatically and independently based on their usage, making it highly scalable.</p>

                </h3>
                <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Vector has an Edge Computing component, in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.

                    Rather than transmitting raw data to a central data center for processing and analysis, that work is instead performed where the data is actually generated -- whether that's a retail store, a factory floor, a sprawling utility or across a smart city.</p>
