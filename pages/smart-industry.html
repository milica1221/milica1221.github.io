            <p class="paragraph-1">OEE â€“ overall equipment effectiveness- is one of the most holistic metrics an organization can use to measure an asset's performance. When it comes to finding improvements in cost and productivity, the overall equipment effectiveness metric does a great job of shedding light into the effectiveness of key resources.By relying on real-time data provided by Nova Vector platform, manufacturers are gaining quicker insights and can determine which areas of availability, performance and quality are most impacting performance.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-1">Recording and classifying stoppages is a simple process in which the operator working on the machine needs to press a corresponding LoRa button, which will send data to Nova Vector platform -and the platform will do the rest.

                    By recording and classifying stoppages using the Nova Vector platform, the manufacturer can gain new insight into how manufacturing equipment and machinery life spans can be improved. By combining real-time data with predictive analytics, it's possible to determine when a given machine will need repair and therefore prevent unnecessary stoppages and possible loss of time.</p>

            <h3 class="title-1">Get Insight into Stoppage Type, Count and Duration</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-1">With Nova Vector recording and classifying stoppages, there is also the ability to take a look at all the collected(or real-time) data using a custom made Stoppage/Reason code report.

                The report can be filtered as per client's wishes, but the most important filters would be production line, product and date/time. Using that information, the client can determine the situations in which he can improve planning as well as make a plan how to minimize number of unplanned stoppages.</p>
