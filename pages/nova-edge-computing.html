                        <p>Nova Edge computing enables real-time data processing at the edge of the network, closer to devices and sensors. This reduces network disruptions, latency, and bandwidth limitations associated with traditional centralized server architecture.</p>

            <h3 class="title-1">Why Edge Computing</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-1">Traditional enterprise computing architectures built around centralized servers can face issues such as network disruptions, latency, and bandwidth limitations. Nova Vector offers an integrated Edge Computing solution and management tools to address these problems.
                With Nova Edge, you can move some of the data processing out of the data center and onto the factory floor.

                This enables you to send only the results of that computing work, such as real-time business insights, equipment maintenance predictions, or other actionable answers, back to the main data center for review and other human interactions.</p>
            <h3 class="title-1">Nova Edge - Computing on the IoT Edge</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-1">Nova Edge is a computing solution based on the Linux Foundation IoT edge computing project called EdgeX Foundry. We verify EdgeX Foundry's compatibility with Nova Vector Industry 4.0 platform and behavior, then fork it and add it to our Support and Professional Service plans</p>

            <h3 class="title-1">EdgeX Foundry/ODIC</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-1">EdgeX Foundry is an open-source platform hosted by the Linux Foundation. It provides a common framework for industrial IoT edge computing and allows for application portability through containerization (e.g., docker), simplifying application deployment and orchestration.

                Janko Isidorovic, the founder of Nova Vector, was Chair of the Application Working Group in the Linux Foundation EdgeX Foundry from the project start until the release of EdgeX Foundry v1.0

            <h3 class="title-2">Modular, Microservice Architecture
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Just like Nova Vector Platform, the Nova Edge is designed as a set of microservices. The Nova Edge microservices can be divided into several logical groups.

                - Device Services provide connections to the devices and sensors.
                - Core Services are responsible for device management, sending commands to connected devices, and configuration of the edge server.
                - Supporting Services consist of Rule Engine, Scheduling, and Alerts and Notification services.</p>

            <h3 class="title-2">Edge Server Management
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Vector Platform has a container management component that can be used to manage edge servers. You deploy a management container on the edge server, which connects to Nova Vector platform and enables you to deploy docker containers or docker-compose scripts to the edge server.

                Using the integrated FaaS component, you can develop functions on the main server, package them as containers, and push them to the edge.</p>

            <h3 class="title-2">Realtime Data Processing on the Edge
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Edge enables data processing at the IoT edge. Device data streams can be forwarded to the built-in rules engine, where they can be transformed using SQL-like language. The rules engine output can be pushed to the Rest HTTP server, MQTT broker, EdgeX message bus, or log file.
                In addition to the rules engine, the system has Application Services that provide several standard functions for data transformation, including: Compression, conversion, encryption and Filtering Export.
